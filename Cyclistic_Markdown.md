## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing
believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number
of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how
casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to
convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic
executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up
with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Since the director of marketing wants to maximise the number of annual
memberships I had to find out how many trips have been done by members
and casual riders.

Now that we know that the casual riders use the bikes more than the
members, it would be useful to know when the bikes get used the most to
target the marketing strategy. I calculated the rides per day of the
week.

Friday and Saturday are clearly the most popular days of the week
followed by Thursday.

It would make sense to increase the incentive to use the company’s
service on less popular days through marketing and targeted
advertisement.
